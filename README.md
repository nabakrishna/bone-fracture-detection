## About the Project
BoneScan AI is our hands-on project where we took a pre-trained YOLOv8 model and fine-tuned it ourselves on 8K+ real X-ray images to detect bone fractures. Doctors can upload an X-ray, and within seconds get bounding boxes around fractures, confidence scores, and helpful medical insights.

The system combines cutting-edge machine learning technology with a user-friendly interface, allowing doctors and radiologists to simply upload X-ray images and receive immediate AI-assisted analysis with confidence scores and medical recommendations.
